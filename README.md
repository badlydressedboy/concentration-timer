# concentration-timer
 
A windows app to help concentration by displaying a countdown timer and coloured flashes as the countdown gets closer to zero.

The current task can be named by using a text box.

The time can be reset, paused, added to, subtracted from.

The window can be resized and the text scales with it. I find the more important the task, the more screen should be filled with the app.

The background is white but flashes every 10 seconds - 
* Green: > 10 minutes left
* Orange: <= 10 minutes left
* Red: time has run out

App icon is googley eyes as they most accurately capture the expression of someone when they realize how much task there is to do in so little time.
